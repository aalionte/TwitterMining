# TwitterMining

This program used the libraries JSON-simple and JGraphT in the "lib" folder.

If you need to run this code, you have to change 2 places below:
	private static String userDataPath = "E:/TwitterMining/data/";
	private static String userGitPath = "E:/Github/TwitterMining/";
	
	with the userDataPath is where you store the data
	with the userGitPath is where you want to store the output files.
